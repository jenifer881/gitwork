<p id="blue">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round. </p>
<h1 class="red">The general flow of a game then is roughly as follows:</h1>

<div class="g">
<fieldset class="f">

<ul>
<li>You'll spawn in the plane, and need to choose somewhere to land. We've put together a dedicated guide on the best PUBG loot locations on Erangel and Miramar, as well as specific pages on the Erangel map and Miramar map, too, but the short version here is that you want to avoid high-traffic areas like major towns and cities, and find a safe little spot to loot some weapons and equipment on your own.</li>
<li>Then, when you're all set (or run out of things to loot before the electrical field starts getting close) it's a case of going where the white circle is. You'll need to find safe points to rest, loot, and defend yourself along the way, while the player count gradually drops, until you ideally reach the last 10 or 15 players.</li>
<li>At that point, most people's strategies go out the window, but hopefully that's where the final part of this page comes in most handy, where we go through not only the useful stuff for the early and mid game, but some advanced tips for winning that final fight to the death.</li>

<h1 class="red">PUBG beginners tips for mastering Battlegrounds</h1>
<p style="color:pink">PUBG can get a little overwhelming, especially for beginners, so here's a rundown of the basics that you need to know - and some useful stuff that it really helps to get to grips with early - before we start diving into the more advanced strategies.</p>
<h1 class="red">Mastering the essentials: setting up and basic controls</h1>
<fieldset>
<ol>
<li>Remember to put away your weapon (the X key on PC), meaning you can sprint six per cent faster</li>
<li>In the pre-game, take off your shoes! Barefoot running is the same speed as running with shoes, but you're noticeably quieter on most surfaces.</li>
<li>To refuel, the vehicle needs to be completely static, but you can still refuel from within the car by right-clicking the cannister in your inventory.</li>
<li>Use map markers at all times, and call out specific directions (numbers as well as North/South/East/West) when in a team.</li>
<li>You can stay in the game's voice chat, but set your own chat to party-only - occasionally you'll overhear enemy teams who forgot to set theirs to private.</li>
<li>Remember to toggle your rate of fire with the B key or left on the d-pad on console.</li>
<li>There are not two, but three types of aiming. Hip fire, a more accurate hip-fire (holding right mouse-button), and aiming-down-sights ('ADS', by tapping right mouse-button). You'll also be able to change the settings to go straight to ADS by holding right-click rather than toggling it.</li>
